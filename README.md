1. Create a list of options: <code>["rock", "paper", "scissors"]</code>.  
2. Ask the player to choose their move by entering a number:  
   - <b>'0'</b> for Rock  
   - <b>'1'</b> for Paper  
   - <b>'2'</b> for Scissors  
3. Generate a random number between 0 and 2 for the computer’s choice.  
4. Display both the player’s choice and the computer’s choice.  
5. Compare choices using the rules of Rock–Paper–Scissors:  
   - If both choices are the same → it’s a <b>draw</b>.  
   - Rock beats Scissors → Rock wins.  
   - Scissors beats Paper → Scissors wins.  
   - Paper beats Rock → Paper wins.  
6. Print the result (<b>Win, Lose, or Draw</b>).
